## Notes

I found it challenging to implement the interactive buttons in the detailed view of creators. The exemplar's version of these buttons resize themselves when the cursor hovers over them to create a smooth and slick animation. However, since I used a grid display for the container, resizing these buttons would also move the contents below them, leading to a weird and buggy animatin in my implementation. In the end, I decided to make these buttons static in terms of their size upon hover.
